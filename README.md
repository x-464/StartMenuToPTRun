'.exe' contains the .exe you'll want to have open on launch, which can be set in task manager
'all code' contains the C++ code for the program if you want to look over it.

This is a silent program and will just show in the system tray.

Feel free to take this code and improve it as you please, I doubt it's that optimised as I spent maybe a few hours on it at best but it uses next to no system resources anyways.

Enjoy!
