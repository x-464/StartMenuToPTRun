'.exe' contains the .exe you'll want to have open on launch, which can be set in task manager
'all code' contains the C++ code for the program if you want to look over it / ask GPT what it should do.

When running the program nothing will show up on your screen, there will also be nothing in your task tray. (this is because I am not smart enough and do not have the time to do this currently).

To turn it off you will have to go into task manager, look for 'CustomTaskbarAndPTRun.exe' (which should show close if not at the top), right click it and press end task.

Feel free to take this code and improve it as you please, I doubt it's that optimised as I spent maybe a few hours on it at best but it uses next to no system resources anyways.

Enjoy!
