'.exe' contains the .exe you'll want to have open on launch, which can be set in task manager
'all code' contains the C++ code for the program if you want to look over it / ask GPT what it should do

When running the program nothing will show up on your screen, there will also be nothing in your task tray. (this is because I am not smart enough and do not have the time to do this currently)
To turn it off you will have to go into task manager, look for '_StartMenuToPTRun.exe' (which should show close if not at the top), right click it and press end task

Feel free to take this code and improve it as you please, I doubt it's that optimised as I spent maybe a few hours on it at best but it uses next to no system resources anyways

Enjoy!
